## Safe redundant geo location reusing devices 

This project aims at **increasing safety of redundant location for rescue** 

**What**: Simple GPS signals to display locations.

**How**: Building tiny systems to track locations, based on affordable hardware and know-howr. [Circular](circular.html) reusing simple devices. 

**Why**: Conscious about safety in rescue and finding missions.

**Where**: Suitable for local rescue k9 demo under consideration now.

**Status**: TRL4 x CRL3 . Lab demo of integrated system x Validate the Market hypotheses

**Affordable**
Overall the project relies in using existing devices and know-how

Mission: to bridge the tech gap using open-source tools, training, and low-cost innovation ‚Äî so even small associations or villages can benefit from solutions once reserved for corporations.

**Examples of affordable solutions:** adding demo or redundancy:

- Instead of ‚Ç¨900 GPS investment we build ‚Ç¨90 [simple locations](gps.html), (less precise than commercial yet 9 times its price) zrydys.github.io/gps.html
- Small sets democratize usage and allow faster reusing of existing elements
- Replace $1000 marine tools by $150 DIY kits. [simple green AIS](ais.html) zrydys.github.io/ais.html 

Promoting **circular economy** solutions where we can share, reuse, repair, refurbish existing devices. (contributing also to diminish pollution on disposal of old cellular or laptops)

### NMEA
NMEA 0183 is a communication standard used for transmitting data between marine electronics, such as GPS receivers and sonar devices, using a simple ASCII serial protocol. It allows one device (the talker) to send data to multiple devices (listeners) and is gradually being replaced by the newer NMEA 2000 standard in leisure marine applications.

### Project Method 

Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI) measures scope definition, identify gaps, and take actions to reduce risk during front end planning. The PDRI facilitator shares  a summary report with all project stakeholders. [^rm] [^doe]
