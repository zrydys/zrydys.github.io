## Circular solutions 

Promoting **circular economy** solutions where we can share, reuse, repair, refurbish existing devices. (contributing also to diminish pollution on disposal of old cellular or laptops)

**Mission**: to bridge the tech gap using open-source tools, training, and low-cost innovation ‚Äî so 1) all can benefit from IT once reserved for corporations and 2) build green renewable solutions.

Building tiny integrated systems based on affordable hardware and know-how. [Circular](circular.html) reusing of simple devices, open software, .... 

Conscious about green economy, reducing waste, reusing electronic devices...

**Examples of affordable solutions:** providing demo or redundancy:

- Instead of ‚Ç¨900 GPS investment we build ‚Ç¨90 [simple locations](gps.html), (less precise than commercial yet 9 times its price) zrydys.github.io/gps.html
- Small sets democratize usage and allow fast reusing of elements
- Replace $1000 marine tools by $150 DIY kits. [simple green AIS](ais.html) (ais = zrydys.github.io/ais.html)
